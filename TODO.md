### TODO LIST:

* When we get two tetrisis (tetri?) the blocks only move down one and some are left floating in the air (Roman)

* The thanks looser/thanks winner screen has no reset instructions since I broke that lol and the score displays funny there now. Since we need to reset the actuator and syringe, maybe just put a message saying "refill syringe, pull back plunger, and manually push actuator to reset, then click reset on the arduino to play again" or something like that. (Roman)

* Shows current peice rather than next peice. (Roman)

* We need to use interrupts for the buttons. (Son)

* We need to use manual register manipulation for the water gun et al. (Gabe)

* Video (???)

* Final schematic (???)

* Final submission (???)
