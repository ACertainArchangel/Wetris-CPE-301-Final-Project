### TODO LIST:
* The thanks looser/thanks winner screen has no reset instructions since I broke that lol and the score displays funny there now. Since we need to reset the actuator and syringe, maybe just put a message saying "refill syringe, pull back plunger, and manually push actuator to reset, then click reset on the arduino to play again" or something like that. (Roman)

* We need to use interrupts for the buttons. (Son)

* We need to use manual register manipulation for the water gun et al. (Gabe)

* Video (???)

* Final schematic (???)

* Final submission (???)
